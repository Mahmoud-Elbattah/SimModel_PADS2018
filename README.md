Simulation Experiments for SIGSIM PADS 2018 Paper

The simulation experiments included two parts. First, the simulation model was guided by a good classifier ML model. The second part of experiments used the same exact simulation model, however guided by a poor classifier model.

The ML models can viewed at Azure ML Studio through the URLs in the .txt file.
